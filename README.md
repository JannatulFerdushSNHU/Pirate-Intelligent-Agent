# Project Reflection

## Work Completed on This Project
In this project, I worked on developing an intelligent agent using a neural network. I was given some basic guidelines and provided base code and examples of how neural networks work. I wrote my own code to design, train, and test the neural network for the agent.
For example, I created the neural network model, chose the right parameters, and trained it with data to make the agent perform specific tasks. This helped me practice important skills like machine learning, debugging, and testing.

## Connecting Learning to the Field of Computer Science

#### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve problems using technology. They write programs, design systems, and find better ways to do things. Their work is important because it makes life easier, faster, and more connected. For example, intelligent agents like the one I worked on can help automate tasks and make decisions faster.

#### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When I face a problem, I follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: I think about what is needed and what I have to do.
2. **Break it into parts**: I divide the work into smaller, easier tasks.
3. **Plan the solution**: I decide how to solve each part step by step.
4. **Write and test the code**: I write the program and check if it works properly.
5. **Improve if needed**: If something is wrong, I fix it or make it better.

This way of working helped me complete this project successfully and learn new things.

#### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
I have a duty to be responsible in my work:

- **For the user**:
  - Protect their data and keep it safe.
  - Make the software easy and fair for everyone to use.
  - Be honest about what the software can do.

- **For the organization**:
  - Deliver good-quality work that works well.
  - Follow company rules and coding standards.
  - Think about the results of the project and avoid causing harm.

This project taught me how important it is to think about the people who will use my work and the company that trusts me to do it.
